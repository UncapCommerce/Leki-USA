His name was Johannes Klaebo, who is now one of the most successful cross-country athletes in the world. After the 2013 Junior World Championships, we offered him his first contract. The value of partnership also plays a big role in Johannes' life. He is part of a large family that has supported him since he was very young. His trainer is his grandfather, Kåre Høsflot, his father Håkon is his manager, and his brother Ola, who is five years younger than he is, is his social media manager. His younger sister acts as interpreter and his mother takes care of the finances. Partnership is the foundation for any success.",
