Over the course of the year, LEKI generates 7% more electricity than its total energy consumption. This extreme electricity savings also noticeably reduces COÂ² emissions by over 33 tons of COÂ² per year. In 2014, we also installed an intelligent and highly-efficient energy-saving lighting system. Since then, we have equipped our production and storage rooms with energy-saving LED lighting.
