Karl was a passionate skier and dreamed of the perfect ski pole. He made it his business to replace the fragile bamboo shafts that were used as ski poles at that time. With his experience in the aircraft industry, he constructed the first pole out of aluminum. A material that is sturdy, light, and flexible at the same time. Since then, new innovations and improvements occur almost every day at LEKI. We always address the needs of our top athletes first –   we are only satisfied when the best in the world are 100% satisfied. For us, it's not only important to get feedback from world-class athletes, but also to listen to enthusiastic recreational athletes. We want to ensure that our products and innovations meet the needs of all users. The history of LEKI is the history of our customers and partners and their undertakings and experiences, to climb the tallest mountains, to participate in the race of their lives, or to discover unknown places.",
