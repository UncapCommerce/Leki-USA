Karl was a passionate skier and dreamed of the perfect ski pole. He set out to replace the fragile bamboo shafts that were used for ski poles at the time. With his experience in aircraft construction, he constructed the first floor out of aluminum. A material that is stable, light and flexible at the same time. Since then, new innovations and improvements have been created at LEKI almost every day. We always start with our top athletes. Only when the best in the world are 100% satisfied are we too. For us, however, it is not only important to get feedback from world-class athletes, but also to listen to the enthusiastic recreational athlete. We want to ensure that our products and innovations meet the needs of all users. The story of LEKI is the story of our customers and partners and their adventures and experiences, climbing the highest mountains, driving the race of your life or discovering unknown places.",

With trail running, LEKI now has this racing experience and expertise in summer too. That is why racing is not only part of our history, but also inextricably linked to the future of LEKI.
